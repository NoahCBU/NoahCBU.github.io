		<h2>So you've found my little abode...</h2>
		<p>Glad to see you here! I'm sure you're probably looking for a means to see my prior experience,
			or are looking to get something from me, be it my services in software engineering or even some artwork.
			That being said, you've come to the right place! I'm [-NAME-], though most people just know me by Noah.

		<ul>
			<li>Who exactly am I:
				<ul><li> I'm a college student who also has a hobby for modeling in 3D.</li></ul>
				<!-- This can be replaced with some other name/credentials that can further obscure my identity, in the situation that I use this in a public setting rather than a college setting -->
			</li>
			<li>As of right now, what experience do I have:
				<ul><li>I'm currently in college for a bachelor's degree in software engineering, and I'm currently planning for an internship/volunteer work this summer.</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li>Anything important to keep in mind:
				<ul><li>I'm an autistic adult, diagnosed at an early age, though that shouldn't be a detriment to being able to work. If anything, it's made me even better of a worker.</li></ul>
			</li>
